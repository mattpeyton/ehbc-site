          <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
          <p>
            The Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>God</h3>
          <p>
            There is one and only one living and true God. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>God the Father</h3>
          <p>
            God as Father reigns over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>God the Son</h3>
          <p>
            Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary.  He lived a sinless life and in His substitutionary death on the cross, He made provision for the redemption of men from sin.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>God the Holy Spirit</h3>
          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine.  He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Man</h3>
          <p>
            Man is the special creation of God, in His own image. He created them male and female as the crowning work of His creation. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore every person of every race possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Salvation</h3>
          <p>
            Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>The Church</h3>
          <p>
            A church is an autonomous local congregation of baptized believers, associated by faith in Jesus Christ and fellowship of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of Christ) Lordâ€™s Supper and Baptism).  Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ through democratic processes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Baptism and The Lord's Supper</h3>
          <p>
            Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water. It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Savior, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus.
The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>The Christian</h3>
          <p>
            All Christians are under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ supreme in our own lives and in human society.  In the spirit of Christ, Christians should oppose racism, every form of greed, selfishness, and vice, and all forms of sexual immorality.

God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. It is composed of persons related to one another by marriage, blood or adoption.  Marriage is the uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime.
